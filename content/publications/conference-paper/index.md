abstract: To foster the core talents of the future, the development of diverse and substantial SW‧AI education programs
  is required, and a systematic system that can assist public education in SW and AI must be established. In this
  study, we develop and combine SW‧AI education modules to construct a SW and AI education program applicable
  to public education. We also establish a systematic education system and provide sustainable SW‧AI education to
  elementary, middle, and high school students through ‘Job's Garage Camp’ based on various sharing platforms.
  By creating a sustainable follow-up educational environment, students are encouraged to continue their self-directed
  learning of SW and AI. As a result of conducting a pre-post survey of students participating in the 'Job's Garage
  Camp', the post-survey values improved compared to the pre-survey values in all areas of 'interest', 'understanding
  and confidence', and 'career aspirations'. Based on these results, it can be confirmed that students had a universal positive
  perception and influence on SW and AI. Therefore, if the operation case of ‘Job's Garage Camp’ is improved and
  expanded, it can be presented as a standard model applicable to other SW and AI education programs in the future.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study proposes a sustainable SW·AI education program for K–12 students and shows that participation significantly improves students’ interest, understanding, confidence, and career aspirations in SW and AI.
