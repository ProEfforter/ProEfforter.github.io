bio: |
  I'm a master’s student at Inha University, Republic of Korea, conducting research in the Visual Computing Lab (VCL) under the supervision of Prof. In Kyu Park.
  My research interests include computer vision, diffusion models, and 3D reconstruction, with a current focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting.
  I received my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Software Convergence Engineering from Inha University in February 2026.
